## 🌌 Project Description

This project creates an artistic and symbolic universe where each celestial body represents a personal or professional milestone.

- Entry begins through a floating lab shielded in space.
- Clicking the computer initiates travel into a realistic solar system.
- Each planet represents a project, skillset, philosophy, or legacy challenge.
- Hidden clues eventually lead to deeper symbolic vaults and final unlockable rewards.

Built with:

- Three.js (3D rendering)
- HTML5, CSS3
- (Optional) Flask or Node.js for backend expansion
- GitHub for version control
- Hosted on Render, Railway, or VPS

## 🧠 Philosophy Behind This Project
